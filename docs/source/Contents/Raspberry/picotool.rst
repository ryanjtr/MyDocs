Installation
-----------------

Install package and dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install cmake build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev

CLone picotool from github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    .. code-block:: bash

        git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool.git
        cd picotool

Build pictotool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    .. code-block:: bash

        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make -j$(nproc)

Install system-wide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo make install

Verification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plug pico board to laptop (hold BOOTSEL to enter USB mass storage mode), then invoke command

    .. code-block:: bash

        picotool info

If you install successfully, you will see information about the device.


Command detail
----------------------

make -j$(nproc)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Meaning

    - **make** → the build program in Linux. It reads the ``Makefile`` to compile the project.  
    - **-jN** → tells ``make`` to run *N jobs in parallel* (compile multiple files at the same time).  
    - **$(nproc)** → a shell command that returns the number of CPU cores on the system.  

* Example

    If your machine has **8 cores**, then ``$(nproc) = 8``.  
    So the command expands to:

        .. code-block:: bash

            make -j8

    This runs **8 parallel build processes**, using all CPU cores to speed up the compilation.

* Comparison


    - ``make`` → only 1 job at a time.  
    - ``make -j4`` → up to 4 jobs in parallel.  
    - ``make -j$(nproc)`` → automatically uses all available CPU cores (fastest).  

* Summary

    ``make -j$(nproc)`` = *compile using as many jobs as CPU cores → maximum build speed*.  

sudo make install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you build software from source (with cmake .. && make), the files are compiled but stay inside your build/ folder. They aren’t “installed” on the system yet::

    make install → runs the install rules defined in the project's CMakeLists.txt or Makefile.

Typically copies binaries (picotool, my_program, …) into system folders like /usr/local/bin/.

May also copy libraries into /usr/local/lib/, headers into /usr/local/include/, etc::

    sudo → needed because writing into /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/lib requires root permissions.

So for example, after::

    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install


You can run the program globally, e.g. just type:

    .. code-block:: bash

        picotool


from any folder, instead of having to run it from inside build/.

.. note::

    If you don't run sudo make install, you can still use the program, but you must call it with a relative path, e.g.::

    ./build/picotool


sudo make install is optional, but convenient if you want the tool to be available system-wide.


Common errors
------------------

Wrong uf2 file for board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will see the error below 

    .. code-block:: bash

        Family ID 'rp2040' cannot be downloaded anywhere
        ERROR: This file cannot be loaded onto a device with no partition table

Your board shows up as RP2350 (Pico 2), but your .uf2 was built for RP2040. The UF2 header contains 
a family ID; RP2040 and RP2350 are different, so the bootloader refuses it.

To solve this problem, please follow the commands below:

    .. code-block:: bash

        rm -rf build
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake -DPICO_PLATFORM=rp2350 -DPICO_BOARD=pico2 ..
        make -j$(nproc)

Then you can load uf2 file to pico board

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo picotool load <name_file>.uf2 -f\


Failed to open /dev/ttyACM0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you see this error in Serial Monitor in VScode, this means the configuration of Serial Monitor is wrong. To fix
it, you have to open ``Command Palette`` (Ctrl + Shift + P) -> enter ``Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)``

Add or edit the configuration::
    
    "C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "ms-vscode.cmake-tools",
    "serialport.defaultBaudRate": 115200,
    "serialport.enableRTSCTS": false,
    "serialport.enableDTR": false
