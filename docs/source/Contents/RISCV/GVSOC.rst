GVSOC

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GVSOC is a lightweight and flexible instruction set simulator which can simulate 
GreenWaves' GAP8 IoT application processor. GVSOC allows execution of programs on a 
virtual platform without any hardware limits. Thanks to device models, full application with 
real device drivers can be simulated. Currently, we provide simulations of devices such as cameras, microphones, LCDs, etc.
