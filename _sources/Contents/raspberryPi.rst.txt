    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo nano /etc/netplan/*.yaml

#. Add a new Wi-Fi network configuration: If you are using Netplan: In the YAML configuration file, you will see a section like the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

        network:
            version: 2
            renderer: networkd
            wifis:
                wlan0:
                access-points:
                    "namchau3":
                    password: "your_password_here"
                    "wifi_moi":
                    password: "password_moi"
                dhcp4: true

#. Save the file (Ctrl + O, Enter) and exit (Ctrl + X).
#. Apply the new configuration:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo netplan apply



Display SSID of Wifi
---------------------------

#. Install wireless-tool

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo apt install wireless-tools

#. Display SSID

    .. code-block:: bash

        iwgetid

Install Visual Studio Code on an Ubuntu Server without a GUI
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can use VS Code Remote Development by connecting to your server via SSH from another machine that has the VS Code GUI. Here's a step-by-step guide:

#. Install Visual Studio Code on Your Personal Computer

#. Install the Remote Development Extension in VS Code

    * Open VS Code on your personal computer
    * Open the Extensions Marketplace (press Ctrl+Shift+X or click the Extensions icon in the sidebar).
    * Search for and install the Remote - SSH extension.
    * After installation, you'll see a ``><`` icon in the sidebar. Click on this icon.

#. Install VS Code Tools on Ubuntu Server via SSH

    * SSH into your Ubuntu Server from your personal computer:

        .. code-block:: bash

            ssh username@your_server_ip
    
    * Install OpenSSH on the server (if it's not already installed) to enable SSH connections:

        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install openssh-server


    * Check the SSH service status:

        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo systemctl status ssh

    * Make sure the SSH service is running. If it's not, start it:

        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo systemctl start ssh


#. Use VS Code to Connect to Ubuntu Server via SSH

    * In VS Code on your personal computer, open the Remote Explorer.
    * Click the + button to add a new SSH connection.
    * Enter the Ubuntu server's username and IP address.
    * Provide the password when prompted, or configure the connection with an SSH key.

#. Edit and Work Remotely on the Server

Once connected, you can edit files on the server as if you're working locally. 
VS Code on your personal computer will interact with the files on your Ubuntu Server through SSH, 
while the server doesn't need to have a GUI.

.. note:: 

    * Visual Studio Code runs on your personal computer but interacts with the code and files on the Ubuntu Server.

    * This method allows you to avoid installing a GUI on the server, yet still enjoy the full functionality of VS Code for development and remote work.

Add priority for Wi-Fi networks
-----------------------------------

#. Open the ``wpa_supplicant.conf`` file

    If the ``wpa_supplicant.conf`` file does not exist, you can create it. To edit the file, use the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

#. Add Wi-Fi Network Configurations with Priority

    In the ``wpa_supplicant.conf`` file, add the configurations for the Wi-Fi networks, specifying the priority for each network. A lower priority number indicates higher priority.

    Example configuration:

    .. code-block:: bash

        network={
            ssid="namchau3"
            psk="your_password_here"
            priority=1
        }

        network={
            ssid="wifi_moi"
            psk="password_moi"
            priority=2
        }

    In this case:

        * The network namchau3 has a priority of 1 (higher priority).
        * The network wifi_moi has a priority of 2 (lower priority).

#. Save and Exit

#. Apply the Network Configuration

    #. To apply the changes with netplan

        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo netplan apply


    #. Alternatively, restart the wpa_supplicant service:

        .. code-block:: bash

            sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant


#. Check the Connection Status

    To verify the Wi-Fi network connection and the priority settings, use the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo snap install network-manager

        nmcli device status


Add Hotspot for Raspberry Pi
--------------------------------

#. Use following command to open ``50-cloud-init.yaml``.
#. Edit file like below

    .. code-block:: bash

        network:
            version: 2
            renderer: networkd
            wifis:
                wlan0:
                    access-points:
                        "Nam Chau 3":
                            hidden: true
                            password: "password"
                        "RaspberryPi-Hotspot":
                            mode: ap
                            password: "HotspotPassword"
                    dhcp4: true
                    addresses:
                        - 192.168.4.1/24
                    optional: true
