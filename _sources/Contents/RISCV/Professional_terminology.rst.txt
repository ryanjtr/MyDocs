Profiling tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A "profiling tool" is a software tool used to gather information about the performance, 
resource usage, and behavior of an application or computer program during execution. This 
tool helps identify weaknesses in the source code that may cause the application to run 
slowly or consume excessive resources.

Some key features of a profiling tool may include:

Data collection: Gathering information about CPU usage, memory usage, system resources, 
and execution time of different parts of the program.
Performance analysis: Analyzing the collected data to identify hotspots, slow functions or 
methods, and areas that may need optimization.
Visualization and reporting: Presenting the collected data in the form of charts, tables, 
and reports to make it easy to understand and analyze.
Source code optimization: Based on the analysis, suggesting improvements or optimizations 
to the source code to enhance performance and optimize resource usage.
Profiling tools are commonly used in software development and deployment to ensure that 
applications perform efficiently and do not encounter performance issues when used in 
real-world environments.

SDK
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An SDK, or Software Development Kit, is essentially a set of tools, libraries, documentation, and 
sample code provided by a platform or technology provider to facilitate the development of software 
applications for that specific platform. Here's a more detailed breakdown along with examples:

Tools: SDKs typically include a variety of development tools to assist developers in building applications. These 
tools may include compilers, debuggers, emulators, and various utilities tailored to the specific platform.

Libraries: SDKs often come with pre-built libraries or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that provide 
access to platform-specific features and functionalities. These libraries abstract away low-level details and 
provide higher-level interfaces for developers to interact with.

Documentation: SDKs usually come with comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the provided tools, 
libraries, and APIs effectively. This documentation typically includes guides, reference materials, tutorials, and sample code.

Sample Code: SDKs may include sample code or example projects that demonstrate how to use various features and 
functionalities of the platform. These examples serve as a valuable resource for developers to learn best practices 
and understand how to integrate specific features into their own applications.

Now, let's look at some examples of popular SDKs:

Android SDK: Developed by Google, the Android SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building 
applications for the Android operating system. It includes tools such as Android Studio (the official IDE for Android 
development), the Android SDK Manager for managing SDK components, and various libraries and APIs for accessing platform 
features like UI components, sensors, and networking.

iOS SDK: Provided by Apple, the iOS SDK enables developers to create applications for devices running the iOS 
operating system, such as iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches. It includes Xcode (the official IDE for iOS development), 
a suite of development tools, libraries like UIKit and Core Data, and APIs for accessing device hardware and iOS features.
